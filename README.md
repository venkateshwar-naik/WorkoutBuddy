#WORKOUT BUDDY
I developed a full-stack workout application that allows users to add, delete, and update exercises, with each user
having a dedicated database to store their data securely. The application features a robust authentication system,
including login and signup functionality, ensuring personalized access for each user. The project is designed to provide
an intuitive user experience, coupled with efficient backend processing to manage and track workouts effectively.
